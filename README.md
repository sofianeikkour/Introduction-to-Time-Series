# Introduction-to-Time-Series

The following work focuses on some basic to advanced techniques used in time series to forecast future prices in the field of finance. I really had a lot of fun working on this use case and I think it's a good foundation for those who want to learn about time series forecasting. There are two notebooks: the first part deals with preprocessing and training the dataset. The second part is saved in a separate notebook and deals with time series forecasting. 

The models used are:
- AR.
- MA.
- ARMA.
- ARIMA.
- SARIMA.
- ARIMAX.
- SARIMAX.
- Auto ARIMA.

**Note:** This code was written on Jupyter Notebook.  
**Language:** Python.  
**Packages:** numpy, pandas, statsmodels, pmdarima, yfinance, math, matplotlib, seaborn, pickle.
